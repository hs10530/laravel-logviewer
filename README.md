#Laravel 4 LogViewer

Easily view and delete Laravel 4's logs.

Inspiration from [Fire Log](https://github.com/dperrymorrow/Fire-Log) for CodeIgniter by [David Morrow](https://github.com/dperrymorrow) and [Larvel Log Viewer](https://github.com/ericbarnes/Laravel-Log-Viewer) for Laravel 3 by [Eric Barnes](https://github.com/ericbarnes)

        ...
    },
}
```

##Usage and Configuration

###Usage

By default, LogViewer will register itself a couple of routes:

 * `logviewer` -> Redirect to today's log, showing all levels.
 * `logviewer/$sapi/$date/delete` -> Delete log from `$sapi` (see: [php_sapi_name](http://php.net/manual/en/function.php-sapi-name.php)) on `$date` (`Y-m-d` format).
 * `logviewer/$sapi/$date/$level?` -> Show log from `$sapi` on `$date` with `$level` (if not supplied, defaults to all).

LogViewer also registers a filter (`logviewer.logs`) to aggregate all the logs in your `storage_path()/logs/` directory and share them with the `$logs` variable.

Future versions will allow you to specify the names of these routes and add your own filters to them (to, for example, require authentication before viewing and/or deleting logs).

###Configuration

 * `per_page`: The number of log messages to show per page via Pagination. Default: 10.
